# End-Screens for Pandemic Horde related videos

An end screen is a final screen on a YouTube video which supports multiple elements. The renders in this folder are carefully aligned to match our most used templates. If you are working in a resolution or type of video which is not yet available reach out to Kalbuir Skirate on Discord.

## Contents
- Sources ([link](/sources/)): Photoshop source files to adjust the various end-screens easily.
- Renders ([link](/renders/)): PNG renders of the end-screens that can easily be used. Be sure to select a matching resolution so that the positioning of the youtube elements matches.


## Missing a resolution or SIG?
Is the end-screen you are looking for not available in your resolution or is your SIG or video type missing? Contact Kalbuir Skirate on Discord and we can make adjustments.
