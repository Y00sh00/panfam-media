# End-Screens for Pandemic Horde related videos

An end screen is a final screen on a YouTube video which supports multiple elements. The renders in this folder are carefully aligned to match our most used templates. If you are working in a resolution or type of video which is not yet available reach out to Kalbuir Skirate on Discord.

## Contents
- Sources ([link](/end-screens/sources/)): Photoshop source files to adjust the various end-screens easily.
- Renders ([link](/end-screens/renders/)): PNG renders of the end-screens that can easily be used.  

## How to add an end-screen?
1. Pick the `*.png` you want from the Renders ([link](/end-screens/renders/)) folder. Be sure to select a matching resolution so that the positioning of the YouTube elements matches. 
2. At the end of your video cross-fade to this image and have this image visible for exactly `5s` excluding the cross-fade.
3. When uploaded to our YouTube channel one of your channel admins will configure the end-channels appropriately. 

## Missing a resolution or SIG?
Is the end-screen you are looking for not available in your resolution or is your SIG or video type missing? Contact Kalbuir Skirate on Discord and we can make adjustments.
