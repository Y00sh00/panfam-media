# Video Capture Guide

## Static Objects in Space
1. To get a cinematic shot of a static structure or object, get a small (preferably cloaky) ship and orbit the structure you’re looking to get a clip of.
2. Right click the structure or object you’re attempting to get the shot of > Track.
3. Adjust zoom and angle as needed to get that perfect shot.
4. Press Ctrl+F9 to hide the UI and Alt+F9 to hide your cursor.
5. Begin recording. (you may have to hide your cursor again after you return to the EVE Window from your recording software)

## Moving Objects/ships that can shoot (requires two accounts)
1. Have the ship you’re wanting to get a clip of orbit something at a safe (preferably orbit what you’re shooting. I recommend a Monitor or something else that won’t be likely to die.)
2. Begin shooting what you’re orbiting with what you want the clip of
3. Alt+tab to the account you’re shooting, look at what you want the clip of as it orbits and shoots.
4. Adjust zoom and angle as needed to get that perfect shot.
5. Press Ctrl+F9 to hide the UI and Alt+F9 to hide your cursor.
6. Begin recording. (you may have to hide your cursor again after you return to the EVE Window from your recording software)

## Capture Ship Models In-game
1. Search for the ship and `show options`
2. Make the window as big as possible, this works best on ultra wides so you can remove the UI
3. Select the Tab with the least UI clutter maximizing the space
4. Start screen recording
5. Use a mouse macro to smoothly drag from one side of the screen to the other staying on the same Y coordinates
6. Record!
7. In the video editor create a looping video by cutting the footage at the right ship rotations positions

## Capture the Galaxy Map
1. Be in a corp without jump bridges or allies with jump bridges
2. 1. Make sure your transparency in your client is off
3. In-game map on fullscreen, the largest possible.
4. Color wise set it to: ???
5. Click on a region to only highlight that region name and the lines, not any other labels. I use Oasa as it's hardly noticeable when highlighted.
6. The top controls you just nuke out with a color block in your video editor
7. Position your camera on the map in a way where you want it to turn from
8. Use a mouse macro to smoothly drag from one side of the screen to the other staying on the same Y coordinates
9. Record!
10. In the video editor create a looping video by cutting the footage at the right rotation position
