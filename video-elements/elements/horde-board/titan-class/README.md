# Titan Class
The `Titan Class` is a huge file with lots of animations used for this explanation https://youtu.be/MWhe1Y_1-40?si=5vtvTEaCCm4qHrct&t=514.

It is not really meant as a file to edit and reuse, but certain elements could be imported to a future Horde Board explaining a different ship class or concept.

## Import to video editor

1. Extract the archive in your video project folder, it will be a huge number of `png` images so extract them to their own folder.
2. In your video editor of choice add an `Image Sequence`
3. In order to sync voice overs and visuals make use of hold frames or make cuts and import the image sequence as an image to have direct control of how long fragments are paused. 

Each video editor is slightly different but generally you want these settings:
- `Use Original Size` to ensure the UX matches future elements you will also import to the video. 
- `Frame Rate` should be `60px`
